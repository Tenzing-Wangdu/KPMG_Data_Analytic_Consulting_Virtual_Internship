#Sprocket Central Data Analyst - Read Me

# Introduction

Welcome to the Sprocket Central Data Analyst project! Sprocket is a client for KPMG and this is a consulting project. As a data analyst for Sprockt Central Pty Ltd, my main goal is to boost product sales by identifying target customers who can add the highest value to the company. This Read Me file will provide an overview of the project, key objectives, and the methodology used to achieve them.

# Company Overview

Sprocket Central specializes in providing top-quality bikes and accessories to its customers. The company is committed to delivering exceptional products that cater to the needs of bike enthusiasts. To enhance sales and maximize profitability, it is crucial to gain insights into customer preferences and target the right audience.

# Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Identifying Target Customers: The goal is to identify a group of customers that can provide the highest value to Sprockt Central. By analyzing their purchasing patterns and behavior, we can tailor marketing strategies to effectively engage and convert these high-value customers.
Data Exploration: We will conduct a thorough exploration of the bike purchases data using Excel as the primary tool. This analysis will uncover trends, patterns, and valuable insights that will guide decision-making.
Industry Preference: By analyzing the data, we aim to determine which industries contribute the most to bike sales. Industries such as financial services, health, and manufacturing will be preferred as target segments for marketing efforts.
Gender Preference: The analysis will reveal customer preferences, and if male customers are found to have a higher propensity for purchasing bikes compared to female customers, marketing strategies will be tailored accordingly.
Geographical Targeting: Targeting customers in specific geographic locations can be effective. States like New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) will be given priority for marketing campaigns and customer acquisition initiatives.
Customer Classification: Based on the insights gained, we will develop a customer classification model to identify and categorize high-value customers. This model will enable personalized marketing strategies and enhance customer experiences.
Methodology

The analysis and model development will be performed using Excel as the primary tool. Excel provides powerful features for data exploration, visualization, and modeling. The process will involve the following steps:

Data Preparation: Importing and cleaning the bike purchases data, customer demographics, and industry information in Excel to ensure data quality.
Data Exploration: Analyzing the data using Excel's built-in functions, pivot tables, and charts to gain insights into customer preferences, industry contributions, and gender preferences.
Target Customer Identification: Using Excel's filtering and sorting capabilities, we will identify the target customers who can provide the highest value to Sprockt Central based on their purchasing behavior and other relevant factors.
Gender Analysis: Conducting gender-based analysis using Excel to determine the preferences and purchasing behavior of male and female customers. This information will guide marketing strategies and customer targeting efforts.
Geographical Targeting: Analyzing customer locations using Excel's mapping and visualization features to identify areas with the highest sales potential. States like NSW and VIC will be prioritized for targeted marketing initiatives.
Customer Classification Model: Developing a customer classification model in Excel based on relevant attributes such as purchase frequency, average order value, and industry preferences. This model will assist in customizing marketing strategies and improving customer segmentation.
